This hackathon will try to address the challenges of banking telecallers when they call blindly to people in order to sell term deposit plans. The aim of this hackathon is to find the most accurate prediction of whether a person to be called will subscribe to the term deposit plan or not using any of the machine learning algorithms. The participants can use the historical data that consists of different features of customers and whether they subscribed to the plan or not. Using this data, the participants need to build a machine learning model in order to make predictions.
